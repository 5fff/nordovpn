List of NordVPN config files and the script to automatically fetch them
I DO NOT own the copyright of the config files as they are provided by NordVPN
Use the script at your own risk

Well... I guess NordVPN directly provides all of the config files in a zip file for you to download, I didn't know it existed ... well, good hands on practice tho

No need to use my script, just download from this link below:
